# Installation
1. Copy & Paste this into terminal on Tuffix:
`git clone https://github.com/13rianlucero/439-project2-LambdaCalculus.git`
2. Open Dr. Racket
3. Open `DFA-simulate` file in Dr. Racket application
4. Hit run in Dr. Racket
    - this runs all tests for both 6.3 dfa and 6.4 dfa
5. (optional)
    - use Dr. Racket console to run an individual test for either dfa
    - execution code is commented at the bottom of the `DFA-simulate` file
